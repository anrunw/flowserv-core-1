Workflow Templates
==================

Workflow templates have two parts: the workflow specification and the parameter declaration.

Workflow Specification
----------------------

The workflow specification has two parts: files and steps.

Files defines unique identifier for all static files (files or directories) and all files (directories) that are generated by the different workflow steps as intermediate results. These files are in the sections *static* and *outputs*, respectively. These are key-value pairs where the key is the unique file identifier and the value is a relative path to the file or directory in the run directory.

These files together with the files that are defined as workflow parameters form the context (environment) for the workflow that is present in the run directory. **All file names are relative path names**.

The steps section defines the individual workflow steps. This is a list of workflow steps, each of which is identified by a unique name, has an optional environment identifier, a list of required input and output files (referenced by their unique file identifier) and a list of workflow steps (this is only for container steps).
